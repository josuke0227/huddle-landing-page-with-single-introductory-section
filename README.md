## My process

Divided the design reference into the smallest building block of the page,
simply tried to style them until I reach to the same design as the reference.
After creating all parts, put them in the appropriate type of HTML layout tags
such as main, section, article and created the bigger block of the components.
Finally I worked with the layout of the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

* It's impossible to allocate width and height to inline elements.
* In <seciton> or <article> tag, you need to put at least one heading element.
